# Downloading Massachusetts Parcels

## Finding by location

Each Massachusetts municipality creates and maintains their own property boundary files. MassGIS has worked to standardize these files across municipalities. 

To learn more about this dataset and access the data codebook, please find <a target = "_blank" href ='https://docs.digital.mass.gov/dataset/massgis-data-standardized-assessors-parcels'>MassGIS Data: Standardized Assessors' Parcels</a>

To find the correct download file by location, select the `From a Map` option.

You will be taken to a web app where you are presented with a data layer showing every municipality in Massachusetts.

Each boundary will be labeled with the town or city name, and the most recent year that town or city's data was contributed to the standardized, open MassGIS dataset.

Zoom in to the area of interest, and select the city or town by clicking on the appropriate polygon.
