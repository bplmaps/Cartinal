# Bring BPL Atlas Tiles into QGIS

The stitched together and hosted web tiles for each of our Boston atlases that serve as the underlying data behind our <a target = "_blank" href ='https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/'>Atlascope project</a> can be brought into any GIS project.

We have done all the georeferencing, stitching and tiling, so you can get started using the mosaiced tiles as GIS layers in your project. This guide will walk through some of the ways to get started using tiles in your project. 

## Ways to use our atlas tiles
- As basemaps 
- Compare between different years
- Create your own inferred data by digitizing features and creating point, line and polygon datasets from the historical imagery
- Combine inferred data from atlas layers with other datasets to tell stories or do analysis

## List of atlas layers
For a complete list and details on how to access the underlying Atlascope data, visit our <a target = "_blank" href ='./resources/documentation/access-urban-atlas-data.html'>Use Digitized Urban Atlases as GIS Source Data documentation.</a>

## Using with Software

### QGIS

1. Find the layer you want to use.

The best way to find available layers by geography is to use <a target = "_blank" href ='https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/'>Atlascope.</a>

Zoom in to a location in Atlascope, and the menus will give you every atlas we have available for that precise location.
