# Georeference a Map

Georeferencing is the process of matching a digital cartographic image file to real-life geography, by adding ground control points (gcps).

::: details A note on the Leventhal Map & Education Center's Map Warper Instance
The Map Warper which was set up as an integration in our Digital Collections site is unfortunately no longer being supported. The overall Map Warper software this was based upon, and the crowdsourced add-on to the original software requires many outdated dependencies that make the tool's upkeep extremely difficult and less-than-operational.

All maps which were georeferenced using our Collections portal instance of Map Warper prior to the software's expiration can still be accessed in our collections by visiting the digital record for a map, and selecting `Downloads → GeoTIFF` 

We apologize for any inconvenience.

## Georeferencing in QGIS

The Leventhal Map & Education Center, which undertakes many digital humanities projects for which georeferencing is a core staple, carries out all georeferencing processes using QGIS. 

QGIS is a free desktop mapping software with a rich suite of functionalities. To get started with QGIS, please find the <a target = "_blank" href ='./resources/guides/download-qgis.html'>Get Started with QGIS Guide</a>.

Once you have QGIS installed on your computer, you can georeference any map by following this <a target = "_blank" href ='https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/georeferencing_basics.html'>Georeferencing Basics Tutorial</a>.

All you need to start georeferencing is an image file of the map you wish to georeference. The Leventhal Map & Education Center and Boston Public Library make all of their digital collections available to patrons at their highest available resolution. 

To access high resolution downloads of our digitized map collections, navigate to the map you wish to georeference in our <a target = "_blank" href ='https://collections.leventhalmap.org/'>Digital Collections</a> and select `Download → Full Resolution, Uncompressed TIFF`
