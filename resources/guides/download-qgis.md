# Get Started with QGIS

For most tasks you wish to undertake involving GIS, the free desktop software QGIS is an excellent place to start.

With QGIS, you can:
- Georeference maps
- Edit the geometry and attributes of GIS point, line and polygon files
- Create your own GIS point, line and polygon files
- Turn tabular data into data that can be mapped
- Manage the attributes or properties of data
- Clean and prepare data for later steps in web mapping
- Perform spatial analysis on data to uncover patterns
- Join datasets together 
- Overlay multiple datasets to compare between them
- Visualize data and create shareable maps
- Export data into multiple formats
- Import downloaded data or cloud-based services
- Much more!

::: details A note about desktop software vs. web maps
QGIS is a desktop software, and therefore mapping done in QGIS will not be immediately hosted on websites that can be shared with others.

A typical workflow would be to think about how you want to share your map, is it a static PDF or an interactive web map? If it is interactive, why, what interactive features does it need to have? Once you have a sense of the answers to these questions, you can use QGIS to get your data ready for the next step, sharing.

QGIS can export maps as static PDFs, or as popular formats of geopatial data like shapefiles, geopackages, geoTIFFs and geoJSONs that can be visualized in other software.

Cloud-based ArcGIS Online is a popular website that has some free functionality for bringing data into web maps. There is a fair amount you can do with ArcGIS Online, but in many cases to get your web map to look exactly how you want, you might need to do your own custom coding.
