# Metadata: data about the data

## Basics of metadata

* To become data detectives, we have to be readers—and writers—of metadata.
* **Metadata** provides information about data. Recording information about datasets is just as important as the dataset itself. Metadata can help answer questions such as:
    * Who collected the data?
    * What methods were used?
    * Why? For what purpose?
* This information is vital for learning how we should or should not use any given dataset. 

## Where to find metadata

* **If it exists,** metadata will typically be on the page where you downloaded the dataset or in a separate textfile that is downloaded with the dataset itself.
* When in doubt, [ask a librarian](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/geospatial/).

<hideable title="Making your own metadata">

* If you are making your own dataset, it is your responsibility to create and share the metadata with others! Be sure to give context to your created dataset so that others may use it with the correct intentions. The Leventhal Map and Education Center offers [guides](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/cartinal/guides/readme-instructions.html) on how to get started capturing good metadata in a README for data preservation and reusability.
