# File Naming Conventions

## Background Information

There are tips to naming your files which can prevent a lot of headaches down the road. Problems can arise due to the way commercial software like ArcGIS manages data, others can be prevented by more general best practices to ensure data is preserved, compatible and usable in the long-run.
