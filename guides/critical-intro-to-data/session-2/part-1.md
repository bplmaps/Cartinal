# Attribute data

## Types of attribute data

* **Review: Attribute data tell us “what” is happening.** This kind of data describes things like household income, air quality, or unemployment rates—things you can’t see with your naked eye.
* For attribute data to be legible to computers, we have to store it in highly structured forms that computers can understand. 
* The two most basic of these forms are **strings** and **numbers**. Strings are combinations of letters: humans can read strings as words or codes. Numbers record countable observations and values.
    * Numbers, in turn, might have different forms of significance, like counts, fractions, or percentages
    * For the most part, a computer can only understand "plain" numbers: **integers** and **decimals**. A percentage sign would trick a computer into thinking that it's looking at a **string**, so it's better to use `0.56` rather than `56%`

Let’s revisit this unemployment map we looked at last session.

Attribute data tell us “what” is happening. This kind of data describes things like household income, air quality, or unemployment rates—things you can’t see with your naked eye. 

As we discussed last time, an essential part of the mapmaking process is making information legible to a computer. Remember: computers aren’t smart. They need information structured in very specific ways in order to process it. So when we record observations about the world, we have to arrange them in established conventions that computers can understand. 

There are two basic forms of attribute data: **strings** and **numbers**. Strings are combinations of letters: humans can read strings as words or codes. Numbers record countable observations and values. What form of data do you think is in the unemployment data table?
