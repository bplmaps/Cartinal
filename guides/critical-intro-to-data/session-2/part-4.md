# Exercise: Finding data

## Comparing data sources and identifying data types

* In small groups, we will review the datasets that participants found for homework. We will also:
* Review some common places to find data and download data. 
* Compare the useability and clarity of these sites.
* Notice different types of data (strings and numbers) within the tables we download.
