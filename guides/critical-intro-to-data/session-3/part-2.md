# From Metadata to Missing Data

**While we may have missing metadata, there is even another category of things that are missing - missing data.**

* These are topics and issues that we may not realize exist because
    * there a few (if any) known datasets about them
    * they are rarely mapped

<aside>

Artist Mimi Onuoha has compiled her thoughts on missing data which you can read [here](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets). She writes the following:

#### Data do not show us a complete picture of the world. Increasingly the concept of "missing data" has been embraced by academics and practitioners to acknowledge that there will always be missing information in even the best datasets. 

</aside>

* **Just because the data doesn't exist doesn't mean it isn't real.** Centuries of societal norms and thought practice have built up into what is mapped and what isn't. 
* We hope this course empowers you to identify what isn't being mapped and what you can do about it! 
* However, sometimes there are strategic reasons for missing data such as privacy and safety of those being counted.

While we may have missing metadata and lacking data transparency, there is even another category of things that are missing - missing data. These are topics and issues that there are very little to zero known datasets about and people thus far have rarely mapped them. Artist Mimi Onuoha has compiled her thoughts on missing data which you can read [here](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets). She writes the following:

#### Data do not show us a complete picture of the world. Increasingly the concept of "missing data" has been embraced by academics and practitioners to acknowledge that there will always be missing information in even the best datasets. 

This suggests that while data gives us the power to see things and bring to light new issues, just because the data doesn't exist doesn't mean it isn't real. Centuries of societal norms and thought practice have built up into what is mapped and what isn't. We hope this course empowers you to identify what isn't being mapped and what you can do about it! However, sometimes there are strategic reasons for missing data such as privacy and safety of those being counted.
