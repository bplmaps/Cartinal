# Metadata on the LMEC Public Data Portal

You can find detailed metadata in the LMEC Public Data Portal. We will walk through how to understand this information using the Internet Access & Connectivity dataset as an example.

### About this data

* The "About this data" section of the page includes an overview or description of the dataset including:
    - What **topics or themes** does the dataset address?
    - What **time period** does the dataset cover?
    - **Where** in the world does the dataset represent?
        - *Many, but not all, are of Boston!*
    - **Who** originally collected and cleaned the dataset?
    - **Why is it archived** in the LMEC portal?
* As well as other basic descriptive information like the **key attributes** and **access conditions**.

### The data lifecycle
* The data lifecycle tells you where and how people have worked with, changed or edited the data
* This section provides links to the records of those who have worked with data, describing, in their own words, their steps and choices
* You will not find this in most data portals, but we think it is important to preserve
* You can use this section to understand how the data has been shaped, and by whom
* You can also use this section to repeat the steps of the original data processor

### "Can You Trust This Data?""

* This section shows an evaluation of the dataset *and its metadata* by LMEC Data Archivist Belle Lipton.

* These evaluations aim to understand the value and limitations of the datsets that live on the portal, asking questions such as:
    * Will using this dataset cause harm to those it is mapping?
    * What is the intent behind the datasets?
* It is a unique feature of the LMEC Public Data Portal:
    * it's not a section you'll see consistently on sites that provide datasets.
* Data documentation is increasingly important to understand where the data is coming from.





### Data transparency

* **Data transparency** applies not only to maps—"where does the data on that map come from"—but also to the data itself.
* Both data and metadata needs to be looked at through the lens of transparency!
* As critical viewers of data you should begin to prioritize and value ethical data transparency in order to make fair choices about what can and cannot be said from a given dataset.
