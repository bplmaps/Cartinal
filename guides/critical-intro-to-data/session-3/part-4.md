# Metadata Helps Missing or Messy Data

* While we may have missing metadata, there is even another category of things that are missing: **missing data**.
* These are topics and issues that we may not realize exist because:
    * there a few (if any) known datasets about them; or
    * they are rarely mapped
* **Just because the data doesn't exist to map it, doesn't mean it isn't real.** Centuries of societal norms and thought practice have built up into what is mapped and what isn't.
* Sometimes there are strategic reasons for missing data such as privacy and safety of those being counted.
* But we hope this course empowers you to identify what isn't being mapped, identify *why*, and then figure out what you can do about it!

While we may have missing metadata and lacking data transparency, there is even another category of things that are missing: missing data. These are topics and issues that there are very little to zero known datasets about and people thus far have rarely mapped them. Artist Mimi Onuoha has compiled her thoughts on missing data which you can read [here](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets). She writes the following:
> "Missing data sets" are my term for the blank spots that exist in spaces that are otherwise data-saturated. My interest in them stems from the observation that within many spaces where large amounts of data are collected, there are often empty spaces where no data live. Unsurprisingly, this lack of data typically correlates with issues affecting those who are most vulnerable in that context.

Essentially: Data do not show us a complete picture of the world. There could be very real and pervasive phenomena in the world that we experience as humans that—because it's not recorded into datasets—does not get mapped. It's important to remember that just because the data doesn't exist to describe a phenomenon doesn't mean the phenomenon isn't real. Centuries of societal norms and thought practice have built up into what is mapped and what isn't. We hope this course empowers you to identify what isn't being mapped and what you can do about it! However, sometimes there are strategic reasons for missing data such as privacy and safety of those being counted.

Onuoha also outlines a few reasons why data are missing, including
> 1. Those who have the resources to collect data lack the incentive to (corollary: often those who have access to a dataset are the same ones who have the ability to remove, hide, or obscure it)
> 2. The data to be collected resist simple quantification (corollary: we prioritize collecting things that fit our modes of collection).
> 3. The act of collection involves more work than the benefit the presence of the data is perceived to give.
> 4. There are advantages to nonexistence.

Does this list make you think of any recurring themes we've discussed in this class? Can you think of an example of a missing dataset?
