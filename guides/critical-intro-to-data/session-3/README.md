# Session 3: Becoming a Data Detective

Welcome back to **Making Sense of Maps and Data**!

What makes a dataset useful? In what contexts can data be used to advance an idea and when should we be wary of the limitations of using certain data? How should we consider the information given by the data providers?

In this Session, we’ll cover these questions by introducing the concept of “metadata.” We will then provide more resources for taking your mapping skills to the next level and work through a fun, in-class mapping exercise.
