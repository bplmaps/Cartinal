# Session 3: Becoming a Data Detective

Welcome back to **Making Sense of Maps and Data**!

In this Session, we’ll cover these questions by introducing the concept of “metadata.” We will then provide more resources for taking your mapping skills to the next level and work through a fun, in-class mapping exercise.

## Key Questions

* What makes a dataset useful?
* In what contexts can data be used to advance an idea and when should we be wary of the limitations of using certain data?
* How should we consider the information given by the data providers?
* What have we learned in this course? What projects do you want to tackle?

## Key Terms

* Metadata
