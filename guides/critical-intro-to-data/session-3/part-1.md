# Metadata

What does it mean for data to be "good?" Is there such a thing as "bad data?" If so, how do we recognize the difference? In this Session, we'll cover these questions by introducing the concept of "metadata." We will then provide more resources for those looking to take their mapping skils to the next level! 


#### To become data detectives, we have to be readers—and writers—of metadata. 

Metadata provide information about that data such as 
* Who collected the data? 
* For what purpose? 
* What methods were used? 
* When did they collect the data, and when was the data last updated? 
* How was the project funded? 


## Metadata on the LMEC Public Data Portal 
The LMEC Public Data Portal has a variety of unique metadata available which we will walk through the various sections below using the Internet Access dataset as an example.

### Bad Metadata?
What would a bad example of metadata look like? 

Take a look at another dataset on the points where WiFi is available in Boston. Look at the difference and the sections that are missing. We will discuss this in class.

## Metadata

#### To become data detectives, we have to be readers—and writers—of metadata. Metadata provide information about data. Recording information about datasets is  as important as the dataset itself. Recall the questions we first asked of data in Session 1: Who collected the data? For what purpose? What methods were used? When did they collect the data, and when was the data last updated? How was the project funded? These are all questions that can be answered in metadata. This information is vital for understanding what biases might live in datasets.  

If it exists, metadata will often be on the page where you downloaded the dataset or in a separate textfile that you get when you download the dataset itself. If you are making your own dataset, it is your resposibility to create and share the metadata with others! Be sure to give context to your created data so that others may use it with the correct intentions.

### Metadata on the LMEC Public Data Portal 
The LMEC Public Data Portal has a variety of unique metadata available which we will walk through the various sections below using the Internet Access dataset as an example.

#### General Overview
When you enter a page of a dataset on the portal, this section will appear at the top. It includes an overview of where the data comes from, what information it contains, and who can access the data. This info is what you might find on any standard data portal. However, the LMEC portal also offers more comprehensive and critical metadata to consider.

##### Can You Trust This Data
One unique feature of the LMEC public data portal is the "Can You Trust This Data" section evaluated by LMEC Data Arhivist Belle Lipton. These evaluations aim to understand the value and limitations of the datsets that live on the portal. Will using this dataset cause harm to those it is mapping? What is the intent behind the datasets. Data documentation is increasingly important to understand where the data is coming from.

##### Data Lifecycle Section
Another unqiue entity you will find on the data portal is individuals involved in the data lifecycle, both creation, maintaining and cleaning. Here you can even find a record of the decisions made by the data creator along with how oftne the data is updated. This crucial information helps you to make decisions as to what you can apply this data to and to what extent it is valuable for your own purposes.

### Bad Metadata?
So you've just seen examples of good comprehensive metadata that can help put the data in context. What would a bad example look like? Take a look at another dataset on the points where WiFi is available in Boston. Look at the difference and the sections that are missing. Clearly, there is less information. While the Data Portal strives to provide users with the most information and metadata possible, it does not just make up data! The metadata is missing here because the original source did not provide insight as to how the data was made, collected, and documented. Remember portals are just an instrument used to find data and any info that may be associated with it - it is up to you to evaluate the good data from the bad!

##### Wicked Free Wi-Fi, an example that lacks metadata in comparison to the first dataset we looked at.

This idea of evaluating data and the metadata known about it brings up the idea of **data transparency**, how easy it is to understand where the data is coming from and how it was made. While the first Internet Access Every data set had comprehensive metadata this Wicked Free Wi-Fi dataset does not. When you notice a dataset with bad metadata, exercise caution when using the dataset to evaluate both its merits and especially its limitations. You wouldn't to use an unknown book in your journal article! The same principle applies here!
