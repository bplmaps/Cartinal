# Metadata: data about the data

## Basics of metadata

* To become data detectives, we have to be readers—and writers—of metadata.
* Metadata provides information about data. Recording information about datasets is  as important as the dataset itself. Metadata helps answer questions such as
    * Who collected the data?
    * For what purpose?
    * What methods were used?
    * When did they collect the data, and when was the data last updated?
    * How was the project funded?
* This information is vital for learning how we can and cannot use a given dataset and helps us understand potential sandtraps in the data

## Where to find metadata

* **If it exists,** metadata will often be on the page where you downloaded the dataset or in a separate textfile that you get when you download the dataset itself.
On the same page as the data
* [Ask a librarian](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/geospatial/)where to find metadata!

<hideable title="Making your own metadata">

* If you are making your own dataset, it is your responsibility to create and share the metadata with others! Be sure to give context to your created data so that others may use it with the correct intentions. The LMEC offers [free guides ](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/cartinal/guides/readme-instructions.html) on how to get started capturing good metadata in a README for data preservation and reusability
