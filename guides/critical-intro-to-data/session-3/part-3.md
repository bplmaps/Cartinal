# In Class Exercise geoJson.io

## Finding Data (5 minutes)
Now, using the critical data skills we have been developing, go find a dataset out in the wild! Try to find a spatial data file on any topic that interests you about Boston - when in doubt pick a geoJson file given the name of the exercise! Make note of what metadata you are seeing for you dataset and keep that in mind. Save that dataset somewhere you can easily navigate to it on your computer.


## Looking at Spatial Data (10 minutes)

Navigate to the Internet Access Data Set on the open data portal by using this [link](https://lmec-data-portal-dev.netlify.app/#/catalog/dkhm2yhrb). Download the GeoJSON file from the page and save it to your computer. Then bring it into geosjon.io by navigating to Open -> File and then locate the file. Notice what appears. Then bring in your other dataset that you find and compare what's different about the two datasets. What regions does it cover? Are there any patterns that you can tell by looking at the data.

<aside>
geoJson.io is a great free online tool to be able to view your datasets however there are many out there! Other options include Carto, ArcGIS Online and QGIS which range in technical level. Anything involving GIS should be able to do what you need for your projects.
