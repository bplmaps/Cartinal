# Data: What Gets Lost in Translation?

Attribute data, the data that tells us *what* is happening, is stored in computer readable files and spreadsheets filled with columns of text and numbers. Oftentimes you can find datasets on online portals and databases ranging from government sources to private companies. 

In this series of workshops, we will be starting to introduce the [Leventhal Map and Education Center's ](https://www.leventhalmap.org/) Public Data Portal. It offers curated Boston centric datasets along with a variety of other resources to kickstart your mapping adventures!

Let's dive deeper into one of the datasets you can find on the portal. Here's a preview of LMEC's downloaded dataset on Boston Public Internet Access.

###### LMEC Boston Public Internet Access Data File

[note: this paragraph is going to Session 2!] Data is stored by computers in a few main types: the most common types are  **strings**, which are combinations of letters, and **numbers**, which keep track of counts and other important values. In this dataset we see a combination of letters and numbers making up the GEO_ID, which is associated to a particular Suffolk County Census tract in Massachusetts. The other columns represent counts of how many total households have and lack internet along with error in the data. The GEO_ID and Name columns are examples of string data, while the other columns shown are examples of number data. 

Files like these offer a behind-the-scenes look at the data that mapmakers work with to create a map. However, it is easy to lose track of the human element in looking at datasets like these. It's crucial to remember that the numbers represent human observations of households with now internet. Someone recorded these observations and organized them into a dataset. There is always a person behind the numbers and strings. Returning to the *context* of the data is a crucial step. [From glancing at this dataset, it might be hard to see how this data might be visualized on a map.]

## What Questions Should We Ask of Data?

To set up the context of datasets, we pose a series of questions: 
* **Who** made the data? 
* **Why** was this data collected? Are there particular motives that lie behind the reason for the dataset's creation? Personal bias of the data collectors can easily skew data to tell one side of the story but not the other. 
* **When** was the data collected? Can the data still be used to make accurate and current conclusions about what it represents. 
* **What** is being counted or collected? Even more interesting to consider, what is not being counted and what implications does that have for the data? 
* **Where** is the region that this data covers? Where was the data collected?

Another important factor to consider is **how** the data was collected and the methods that were employed. Rounding, mistakes during collection, and improper organization can all lead to errors being introduced in the data. If the column headers and title from the LMEC dataset were removed, it would be almost impossible to understand what is being looked at. **Sample size** is another important factor as the qualities or opinions of a small group or area does not necessarily represent the opinion of an entire country.

So far we have primarily focused on attribute data that describes the quality of a given place. But we can also ask questions of feature dataâ€”the *where* data. Remember that feature data include streets, country borders, townlines and other physical elements of the world.Can these physical elements around us change? 


The simple answer is: yes! And we can recognize this in our own lifetimes: street locations, national borders, and boundaries are constantly changing. Climate change presents a particularly stark example. Data that represents the coastline from five years ago is simply out of date. Because of rising sea levels, today's coastline is significantly different than the coastline that the old data represents. Spatial data also needs constant maintenance to stay up to date. We need to ask the same questions of it as we do of attribute data: who, what, where, when, why, and how.

###### Flood Progression Map: 2070 and Beyond

We can see this idea reflected in the LMEC's work to [map the effects of climate change in Boston](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/map-sets/191).  In this map we see how rising sea levels and floods may change the geography of the city and what areas are above water. This reflects how spatial data, like attribute data can change and should be questioned critically as well. 

Another example of how spatial data should be questioned is regarding politically recognized borders and or regions. If one entity - such as a country - does not legally recognize the rights of a certain people or group, their datasets may not reflect the existence of such boundaries. Spatial data should not be taken at face value either!

Essentially, while looking at numbers and letters in organized columns may lead you to believe that data is objective we must not let ourselves be fooled! The decisions that go in to collecting data along with the everchanging world around us means we must not take data given to us at face value but engage in the constant process of updating what we know and asking questions. 

[Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/38.007/-95.844) or OSM for short, is an open source map project created and maintained by the public is a great example of how datasets can be changing and evolving over time. Users can add in polygons, points, and lines to update the world around them - this collective approach to data maitenance is a refreshing take on closed static mapmaking and empowers users to take charge of mapping themselves and their communities. 

However, we must also acknowledge questions of underlying power and privilege that may be hidden beneath the surface on platforms like these. Does everyone have equal access and ability to contribute? Who might feel intimidated to make changes?
