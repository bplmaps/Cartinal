# What is a map? What is data?

You might be wondering, "what's the point of looking at so many maps and data sets? Why can't I just make a map?" And this is a valid inquiry. 

[A good way to think about it is this: when we learned more advanced reading and writing in middle school, we first learned the ins and outs of grammar. We learned different types of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so on), and we learned proper sentence structure. Only when we understand those basics could we start reading and analyzing books, articles, and poetry. Maps are like sentences in this way: they are made up of component parts, which are put together according to a set of rules and conventions. It's only when we know these rules and conventions that we can start making well-considered maps, and being thoughtful consumers of maps made by others.]  

A good way to think about it is like this: data are the component parts that make up a map, just how words are the component parts of a sentence. The use and processing of data are the means by which we make sense of it, just how grammatical structure defines the meaning of a sentence. If we do not understand grammatical theory, we cannot interpret and construct language as fluently. Similarly, taking a look at existing maps and asking about the meta-attributes of data prepare us to know what exactly we communicate when we do build a map. 

[[By learning to interpret, analyze and create digital maps, you are strengthening your geoliteracy skills. What do we mean by geoliteracy?

A good way to think about it is this: When someone is working on their written literacy skills, they usually practice both reading *and* writing to become a more skilled communicator. We believe  visual means of communication (like maps) are exactly the same — in order to best "read" maps, you should also be able to understand a little about the craft by which they are constructed. Today, this almost always involves the use of geospatial data. You can think about data, with all of its formats, rules and structure, like the underlying grammar beneath maps.]]

*transition needed*... lets learn more about what we mean by a map... 

In 1893, long before the advent of mapping software, Lewis Carroll summarized many of the fundamental troubles faced by contemporary mapmakers. In his book Sylvie and Bruno Concluded, he describes a conversation between the narrator and a German man, Mein Herr: 

> “What a useful thing a pocket-map is!” I remarked.
> 
> “That’s another thing we’ve learned from your Nation,” said Mein Herr, “map-making. But we’ve carried it much further than you. What do you consider the largest map that would be really useful?”
> 
> “About six inches to the mile.”
> 
> “Only six inches!” exclaimed Mein Herr. “We very soon got to six yards to the mile. Then we tried a hundred yards to the mile. And then came the grandest idea of all! We actually made a map of the country, on the scale of a mile to the mile!”
> 
> “Have you used it much?” I enquired.
> 
> “It has never been spread out, yet,” said Mein Herr: “the farmers objected: they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlight!” 

You might be thinking, “That’s absurd!” (*Sylvie and Bruno Concluded* is indeed billed as a comedy.) But the absurd comedy of Mein Herr’s one-mile-to-one-mile map exposes one assumption we have of maps: that they are smaller than the space they are representing. We know already, then, that a map is an abstraction of the world. It is a simplification, a representation, a “[scaled model of reality.](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1124891287)” Maps are not supposed to be reality itself—which is why Mein Herr’s map is so preposterous.

Geographer Dennis Cosgove has described maps as an “instrument,” like the microscope or telescope, that “allows us to see at scales impossible for the naked eye to see and without moving the physical body over space.” But, then, would an aerial image count as a map? What about a [hand drawing of your neighborhood](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-coronavirus-lockdown-neighborhood-maps/)? Is a diagram of the body’s circulatory system a map? With such a broad definition, many things can qualify as maps. 

We would all agree that an atlas is a book of maps, that the folded paper map in your car's glove compartment is a map, and that Google Maps is a map. These maps are called **reference maps**: they describe physical qualities of space and the location of physical things, like coastlines, roads, rivers, cities, mountain ranges, and coffee shops. On the other hand, there are **thematic maps**, which show the spatial aspect of a specific theme. There are many different themes that maps can show, like household income, annual rainfall, population density, or air quality. In this course, we focus on the creation of thematic maps because they show us how to work with *both spatial and non-spatial data*. Denis Cosgrove’s image of a microscope or telescope applies here, too: thematic maps “reveal the presence of phenomena that are beyond our normal bodily senses.” We cannot see the themes that are depicted in thematic maps without those themes being visualized.

One example is this map of median household incomes of surface temperatures in Denver. Income and temperature are not things we can see with our eyes as we walk through a space. But when these themes are visualized we can see a pattern emerge. Can you identify what that pattern is?

Thematic maps of Denver, showing the surface temperature and household income. Placing these maps side by side allows us to see how these variables are correlated: it is hotter where residents are of lower income. 

Making a map is a long process of abstraction, translation, and communication. We will soon learn that part of the abstraction begins much earlier than that: in the collection and creation of data. But first, let's make a map!
