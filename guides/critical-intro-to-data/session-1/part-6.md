# How Do We Approach Data?

Now, let’s return to data in context and turn our attention to the [City Health Dashboard](https://www.cityhealthdashboard.com/). Once [recognized](https://carto.com/blog/map-city-health-dashboard/) as Carto’s Map of the Month, the City Health Dashboard provides extensive insights into a number of issues at the city level using census tract data. For now, let’s explore High Blood Pressure in Boston. 

Once we select these details, we can see a map as well as information about what the map means.

By clicking “more about metric” we can learn the data used.

The dashboard even provides a list of “tips and cautions” for interpreting the map and its data. 

Taking a look at the map itself, we can see where high blood pressure is most common and least common throughout Boston, and we can click on specific tracts to see how they compare to the city as a whole. The dashboard’s designers have chosen to make this map interactive using Leaflet.

These cartographers have chosen to include a basemap, providing context to the area, but as we saw in the previous example, cartographers might choose not to provide a basemap depending on the goals for the project. 

This example comes with extensive information about the data used to make the maps, but as we will see throughout the course, maps do not always come with context. In many cases, getting to the root of cartographic decisions will take some extra digging.

### Discussion questions

To apply some of the thinking introduced in this Session, let's compare two maps of sleep deprivation in the United States:

1. [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data_statistics.html)

2. [STAT](https://www.statnews.com/2016/02/18/state-people-sleep-worst/)

Both of these maps were made using *the same data source*, but they represent the data in very differrent ways. How do think cartographic choices influenced the appearance of these maps? Which of these choices do you think were made consciously and subconcsiouly? We will discuss these qustions as a group.
