> **“The map is a silent arbiter of power.” ([Harley](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008/--deconstructing-the-map?rgn=main;view=fulltext))**

This session has been a brief introduction to thinking about the choices cartographers make. But in reality, many of these choices are unconscious. Some choices and biases have become convention, when subjective choices that were made once are repeated and reinforced generation to generation. Any given map we might pick up or click on today is the result of collective decisions that we have come to accept as truths. The expectations we might have for what a map is come from systemic reinforcement of specific traditions of map-making, and perpetuation of these traditions has created a list of “oughts” when looking at a map. Though we have a set of cartographic standards, these too are subjective choices, and there is little that a map must objectively contain. 

When we listen to a political speech, we know that what we hear are subjective opinions. But we don't often think of maps as subjective in the same way. This makes it even more important to consciously dissect what is going on in each piece we look at, and to always remember that maps are the culmination of a series of choices made by a mapmaker.   

By fostering a culture of conscientiousness for mapmakers and viewers, we can understand how they are used to make arguments. We can uncover some of the mystique surrounding cartography and use maps as a productive tool for making our own arguments and understanding those of others. 

Arguments made by maps have the capacity to be powerful; when we “see” problems laid out spatially, it helps us really understand what is going on. Maps can reveal disparities within communities and help lobby for racial and environmental justice. They can show us where gender oppression is particularly pronounced, and they can indicate spatial patterns of underfunding for schools. Maps can help policy-makers understand which parts of their communities need more support. Understanding and using the tools of cartography can help us become more informed citizens with the power to engage with our representatives and communities to enact meaningful, lasting change.

## Session 2 Preview

In the next session, we will begin to explore the Boston Public Library Open Data Portal and how to navigate the data that lives on it. We will also provide foundational tools for making decisions about what data and maps you might create for a project of your own.
