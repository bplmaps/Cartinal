# Introducing geospatial data

## Types of maps

* Maps are an instrument that allow us to see themes and scales that are impossible to see with the naked eye.
* **Reference maps** help us understand spatial relationships at scales we cannot otherwise see. 
* **Thematic maps** show us themes across space, which are otherwise invisible.  
* Both kinds of map show not only space, but also data.

There are, generally, two different types of maps: **reference maps** and **thematic maps**.

**Reference maps** describe physical qualities of space and specify locations of physical features such as coastlines, roads, rivers, cities, mountain ranges, and coffee shops. Examples of reference maps include atlases, road maps, globes, and Google Maps. 

**Thematic maps**, on the other hand, show the spatial components of specific concepts such as household income, annual rainfall, population density, or air quality. In this course, we focus on the creation of thematic maps because they show us how to work with *both spatial and non-spatial data*. 

Geographer Dennis Cosgove has described maps as an instrument, like the microscope or telescope, that “allows us to see at scales impossible for the naked eye." Thematic maps, focused as they are on the spatial distribution of concepts, “reveal the presence of phenomena that are beyond our normal bodily senses.”

### Maps and abstractions

In 1893, long before the advent of mapping software, Lewis Carroll summarized many of the fundamental troubles faced by contemporary mapmakers. In his book *Sylvie and Bruno Concluded*, he describes a conversation between the narrator and a German man, Mein Herr: 

> “What a useful thing a pocket-map is!” I remarked.
> 
> “That’s another thing we’ve learned from your Nation,” said Mein Herr, “map-making. But we’ve carried it much further than you. What do you consider the largest map that would be really useful?”
> 
> “About six inches to the mile.”
> 
> “Only six inches!” exclaimed Mein Herr. “We very soon got to six yards to the mile. Then we tried a hundred yards to the mile. And then came the grandest idea of all! We actually made a map of the country, on the scale of a mile to the mile!”
> 
> “Have you used it much?” I enquired.
> 
> “It has never been spread out, yet,” said Mein Herr: “the farmers objected: they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlight!” 

You might be thinking, “That’s absurd!” (*Sylvie and Bruno Concluded* is indeed billed as a comedy.) But the absurd comedy of Mein Herr’s one-mile-to-one-mile map exposes one assumption we have of maps: that they are smaller than the space they are representing. We know already, then, that a map is an abstraction of the world. It is a simplification, a representation, a “[scaled model of reality.](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1124891287)” Maps are not supposed to be reality itself—which is why Mein Herr’s map is so preposterous.

Making a map is a long process of abstraction, translation, and communication. We know already that part of the abstraction begins much earlier than visualizing space: it begins in the collection and creation of data.
