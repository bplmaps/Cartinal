# Session 1: Reverse Engineering Maps

Welcome to the first session of the **Critical Introduction to Maps and Data**.

In this lesson, we'll take a look at some already-existing maps and understand what was needed to create them. This will help us think about the relationship between "map" and "data." We will begin to think about critical questions that we should be asking of maps and data.

## Key Questions

* What is the difference between "a map" and "data"? 
* How can we interpret what kind of data was needed to make a map?
* When you set out to make a map on a particular topic, what kinds of data will you need?

## Key Terms

* geospatial information
* geometry
* attributes
* rendering
