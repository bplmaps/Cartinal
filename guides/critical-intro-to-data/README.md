# Making Sense of Maps & Data

Welcome to Making Sense of Maps & Data, the Leventhal Map Center's introductory course on geospatial data and maps. In these three sessions, students will learn how digital sources of information get turned into maps and visualizations, how to find data sources for mapmaking projects, and how to think critically about data analysis and cartography.
