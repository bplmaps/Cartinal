# Data Schema Homepage

## Meet our schema ðŸ‘‹

This is the homepage for the LMEC's data description schema. The data description schema is used to write metadata which can power the hosting of open, humanistically-contextualized datasets.

::: tip Schema overview
The schema is organized into 6 top-level categories: `core`, `access`, `tags`, `lifecycle`, `considerations`, and `resources`
- `core` addresses basics of the dataset

- `access` links to URLs for direct data access

- `tags`  uses standard vocabularies and free tags to enable searching and filtering

- `lifecycle` documents the checkpoints at which people have come into contact with or changed the dataset to help paint a picture of the data's lineage

- `considerations` allows the data describer to evaluate the public usefulness of the data's formatting and available context

- `resources` creates a constellation of resources to help someone make sense of the data, including publications, codebooks & documentation, supplementary files, and tutorials
