# Healthy Documentation Checklist


This checklist of questions is used by LMEC Data Librarians to aid in evaluating the health of any given dataset's documentation. Healthy documentation provided by the dataset's creator or maintainer gives people enough information to know how they should and shouldn't use the data.


### Did the data collectors or project designers consider the voices of those who are most likely to be impacted by the dataset?

Q. To what extent does the documentation describe how the data creators or project designers considered the voices of the people who are represented by the dataset, or most likely to be impacted by the dataset?

### Are the data publishers committed to relationships of trust with the public, and if so, how?

Q. Does the documentation communicate what steps are taken to assure participants' privacy?

Q. Does the documentation discuss issues of participant consent? Does it speak to how consent is defined, and the degree to which participants' understand exactly how their data is used?

Q. Does the documentation clarify the data creators' initial motivations for collecting this data, including why it benefits society?

Q. Do published materials by the data provider express a commitment to keeping the data open, and lay out plans or strategies for ensuring its long-term preservation and accessibility?

Q. Do published materials by the data provider outline any opportunities for public collaboration and engagement around this dataset?


### What actions have the data creators taken to avoid the perpetuation of systemic injustice or the repeat of past harms?

Q. How thoughtfully does the documentation reflect on ways the data project could perpetuate past systemic injustices? 

Q. Does the documentation provide notes on the data creators' thinking in relation to the historic circumstances which led up to the dataset's creation?

Q. Does the documentation indicate if there is a potential for any past harms to be repeated by this dataset?

Q. How well does the documentation explain the process by which this dataset came to be, including important actors and funders?

Q. Does the documentation provide sufficient information about relevant methodological choices?

Q. If this data has been cleaned, pre-processed or analyzed, how well could someone new to the data reproduce the processing steps, based on the provided documentation?

Q. If additional assets were required to perform processing or analysis, such as scripts or supplementary files, are they openly accessible and clearly defined?




### Can we understand the potential future impact of this dataset, including what it should and should not be used to show?

Q. Does the documentation state the limitations of the dataset, citing examples of what it can and cannot be used to show?

Q. Does the documentation speak to existing factors, if any, which should be flagged to avoid harm?

Q. If anyone stands to profit from this dataset, does the documentation note that?

Q. Does the documentation indicate methods for measuring the impact of this dataset?
