# Healthy Documentation Checklist


This checklist of questions is used by LMEC Data Librarians to aid in evaluating the health of any given dataset's documentation. Healthy documentation provided by the dataset's creator or maintainer gives people enough information to know how they should and shouldn't use the data.


### Did the data creators consider the voices of those who the dataset is most likely to affect?

Q. To what extent does the documentation describe how the data creators or project designers considered the voices of those who the dataset represents or will most likely impact? 

### Are the data publishers committed to relationships of trust with the public, and if so, how?

Q. Does the documentation communicate data creators' steps to assure participants' privacy?

Q. Does the documentation discuss issues of participant consent? Does it speak to how data collectors have defined consent, and the degree to which participants' understand exactly how their data is used?

Q. Does the documentation clarify the data creators' initial motivations for collecting this data, including why it benefits society?

Q. Do published materials by the data provider express a commitment to keeping the data open, and lay out plans or strategies for ensuring its long-term preservation and accessibility?

### What actions have the data creators taken to avoid the perpetuation of systemic injustice or the repeat of past harms?

Q. Does documentation reflect on ways the data project could perpetuate past systemic injustices?

Q. Does the documentation provide notes on the data creators' thinking in relation to the historic circumstances which led up to the dataset's creation?

### Can we understand who funded, collected and analyzed the data, and how?

Q. How well does the documentation explain the process by which this dataset came to be, including important actors and funders?

Q. Does the documentation provide sufficient information about relevant methodological choices?

Q. If someone has cleaned, pre-processed or analyzed this data, how well could another person new to the dataset reproduce the steps, based on the provided documentation?

Q. If data processing or analysis required additional assets, such as scripts or supplementary files, are they accessible and clearly defined?




### Can we understand the potential future impact of this dataset, including what someone should and should not use it for?

Q. Does the documentation state the limitations of the dataset, citing examples of what someone should and should not use it for?

Q. If anyone stands to profit from this dataset, does the documentation note that?

Q. Does the documentation indicate methods for measuring the impact of this dataset?
