# Health Check Scores


## Overview

These scores are used to aid in the evaluation of available official documentation for a given dataset. You can use them to help evaluate whether data has been described by the official creator or maintainer in a way that effectively provides context, based on the value system espoused by the authors of [this schema](./schema-full.html).
