# Documentation Health Check

## Why do we check? ðŸ¤”

LMEC data librarians use these checklists when writing metadata. These checklists help test the health of any given dataset's official documentation. The goal of this check is to keep track of the expectations we have for our data providers. Healthy documentation should tell us enough about the data so we know how we can use it.
